Figure~\ref{fig:broccoli} is an example of a static figure, committed directly to the repository.
By placing the figure in the \texttt{static} directory, the user informs \texttt{showyourwork} that this figure doesn't have an associated script, and no rules need to be executed in order to produce it.
